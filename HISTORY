	Installed patches for the Plan 9 build submitted by Bakul Shah
	and McKay Marston. Thank you very much!
	Fix: Reference trace was in wrong order in error messages. (s9.c)
	Fix: GC leak in the compiler. (s9.c)
	Added CATCH-ERRORS form. (s9.c, s9.scm)
2018-10-25
	Added CATCH and THROW procedures. (s9.c)
	Error messages are now printed to stdout unless the interpreter
	is run in quiet mode (which is implied when running programs in
	batch mode). (s9.c)
	Fix: SIGINT was caught in quiet mode. (s9.c)
	Longjmp'ing out of a signal handler may cause portability issues,
	even if POSIX allows it. Worked around it. (s9.c)
	Thanks, Bakul Shah, for pointing this out!
	util/fix-help-links is now called util/fix-links.sh (for Unix)
	and util/fix-links.rc (for Plan 9). (util/)

	Forgot:
	Policy change: image files are now loaded from the directory
	specified in the S9FES_IMAGE_DIR environment variable or from
	*one* directory specified in IMAGE_DIR (s9.c). When no image
	can be found there, "./s9.image" will be tried. When this fails,
	too, the interpreter will not start.
	To load the library source code, "s9 -i -" *must* be used; this
	is no longer a fallback.
	Added S9FES-REIMAGINED and SCHEME-9-FROM-EMPTY-SPACE-REIMAGINED
	feature ID's to COND-EXPAND, so you can distinguish between the
	old and new S9 version. (lib/)
	Added the *RELEASE-DATE* top-level variable that is bound to a
	copy of the compiled-in RELEASE_DATE of the interpreter. (lib/)
	Thanks for the idea, Peter!

	SCHEME 9 FROM EMPTY SPACE (REIMAGINED)

	This is a complete rewrite of most of the S9fES interpreter
	with the following highlights:

	- the S9 system now uses a bytecode compiler and abstract
	  machine (earlier versions used a tree walker)

	- the S9 interpreter now uses shallow binding instead of
	  deep binding. This means that

		- symbol lookup is now O(1) (was O(n log n))
		- closure creation is now O(n) (small n, was O(1))

	- the compiler inlines most standard Scheme procedures and
	  lambda-lifts functions when called immediately. That is,
	  ((lambda (x) y) z) will not create a closure (unless Y
	  uses SET!).

	- the table of interned symbols is a hash table now instead
	  of a list.

	- Lots of bugs were fixed in SYNTAX-RULES, but it is still
	  not fully hygienic and a second-class member of S9. Use
	  low-level macros instead!

	New syntax:

	- The IF* syntax is similar to IF:

	  (IF* <true-value> <alternative>)  ==>  <true-value>
	  (IF* #f <alternative>)            ==>  <alternative>

	  (IF* X Y) can be thought of as a very efficient version of

	  (let ((t x)) (if t t y))

	  It is used internally to implement (COND (X)) and OR.

	New procedures:

	- DUMP-IMAGE creates an image file

	- QUIT exits the interpreter

	- CURRENT-ERROR-PORT returns a port that is connected to stderr

	- OPEN-APPEND-FILE is like OPEN-OUTPUT-FILE, but appends output
	  to the given file

	- COMMAND-LINE returns the command line arguments passed to a
	  program (was: ARGV, still available).

	- ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE looks up an environment variable
	  (was: ENVIRON, still available)

	- SYSTEM-COMMAND runs a shell commend (was: SYSTEM, still
	  available)

	Minor changes:

	- the "-f file" command line option is deprecated; use "file"

	- strings can now contain \n (newline) escape sequences

	- CALL/CC is working properly and passes all Petrofsky tests.
	  It is rather expensive, though!

	- *LIBRARY-PATH* is now in list format (was a Unix PATH-style
	   string).

	- *IMAGE-FILE* names the image file in use (or is set to #f).

	- the initial image file is loaded from the directory specified
	  in the S9_IMAGE_DIR environment variable

	- EVAL is now a single-argument function.

	- GENSYM is now a function of no arguments.

	- the STATS function no longer counts reduction steps, but does
	  count allocated vector cells.

	- the BIT-OP function signals an error in case of an overflow or
	  wrong opcode instead of returning #F.
