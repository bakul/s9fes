S9fES  (stats form)  ==>  list

Evaluate the given FORM and return a list containing its
normal form plus the resources used to compute that normal
form:

        - total nodes allocated
        - conses allocated
        - vector cells allocated
        - garbage collections

Each resource count will be returned as a group of integers
representing ones, thousands, millions, etc. Note that FORM
must be quoted or it will be evaluated before passing it to
STATS.

(stats '(reverse '(1 2 3)))  ==>  ((3 2 1)
                                   (0 0 0 0 3)   ; nodes
                                   (0 0 0 0 3)   ; conses
                                   (0 0 0 0 0)   ; vcells
                                   (0 0 0 0 0))  ; GCs
