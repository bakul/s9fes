S9 LIB  (partition proceduce^1 list)  ==>  (list_1 list_2)

Partition a list into elements with and without a given property.
The unary predicate P, which is given in the procedure argument,
specifies the property. The returned value contains two lists,
where the first one holds the elements satisfying the property
and the second one the elements not satisfying the property.

(partition even? '(1 2 3 4 5))  ==>  ((2 4) (1 3 5))
