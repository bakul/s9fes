Extract the individual parts of an URL string and store them
in separate elements of the resulting list. The list has the
general form

      (protocol host path suffix arguments anchor)

Parts that could not be extracted are set to #F.

PROTOCOL is the protocol without the :// part, e.g.: "http"
HOST is the host name part of the path (if a protocol is given).
PATH is the local path including the file suffix, e.g.: "foo/bar.html"
SUFFIX is an extra copy of the file suffix, e.g.: "html"
ARGUMENTS is a list of key/value pairs as typically received
in the '?' part of an URL, e.g.: ("page" . "1")
ANCHOR is an anchor without the '#' character.

The URL-PROTO, URL-HOST, URL-PATH, URL-SUFFIX, URL-ARGS, and
URL-ANCHOR procedures extract the individual parts of the
resulting list.

(split-url "ftp://example.org/foo.bar?a=1&b=2")

                              "example.org"

                              "bar"
                              (("a" . "1")
                               ("b" . "2"))
