S9 LIB  (c2html <option> ...)  ==>  string | unspecific

Render C code in HTML with syntax highlighting. Input is read from
(current-input-stream) and output is written to (current-output-stream)
unless the 'INPUT-STRING: option is specified (see below).

The rendition of the C code will be placed in a PRE container of
the class "ccode" (<PRE class=ccode>). The following container
classes are used to specify the colors and other styles of the
individual elements:

      co  comment
      cp  punctuation
      cs  symbol
      cc  constant
      cr  reserved word/operator
      cl  standard library symbol
      cx  extension

See the "ccode.css" style sheet for examples.

The following <option>s exist;

'FULL-HTML: boolean
      When set to #T, C2HTML will output a full HTML document
      and not just a PRE container. Will not work in string mode.

'LOUT-MODE: boolean
      Generate Lout output rather than HTML output.

'INPUT-STRING: string
      Input is read from a string and output is written to a string.
      In string mode, the 'FULL-HTML: option does not work. When this
      option is set, the result of the procedure will be of the form:

              (attributes string)

      where STRING is the output of the rendering process. See the
      description of 'INITIAL-STYLE: for more information on the
      ATTRIBUTES part. The output string of SCM2HTML is always
      lacking a trailing </SPAN> element.

'INITIAL-STYLE: list
      Initialize the color class and boldface flag with the values taken
      from LIST. LIST should be the car part of an object returned by
      C2HTML previously. It allows to render multiple lines that are
      logically connected by preserving the style across line boundaries.

'TERMINATE: list
      Return termination tags for the color and boldface settings
      specified in LIST (see INPUT-STRING:).

  (c2html 'input-string: "x++")
    ==>  (("cr" #f)
          "</SPAN><SPAN class=cs>x</SPAN><SPAN class=cr>++")
