S9fES  (load-from-library string)  ==>  unspecific

Locate the Scheme source file whose name is specified in STRING and
load it. It is an error to specify a file that cannot be located.
LOAD-FROM-LIBRARY uses LOCATE-FILE to locate a file and LOAD to
load it. It is intended to load files from extension libraries that
may be stored in a set of pre-defined locations.
