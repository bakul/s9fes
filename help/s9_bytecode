S9fES  (s9:bytecode procedure)  ==>  vector

Return a vector containing the bytecode of the given PROCEDURE.
The resulting vector will contain the entire compilation unit
in which the given procedure was defined, including details such
as the assignment to the environment slot of its symbol. When
multiple procedures are defined inside of a BEGIN block, the
compilation block will contain all definitions of that block.

The bytecode instructions contained in the vector are subject
to change without notice.

Rationale:

The S9:BYTECODE procedure is intended to support procedures that
are internal to the S9 interpreter, such as a disassembler. No
user code would normally want to apply this procedure.
