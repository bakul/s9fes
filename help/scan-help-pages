S9 LIB  (scan-help-pages string1)          ==>  list
        (scan-help-pages string1 string2)  ==>  list | unspecific

Search the online help database for entries containing the
word STRING1 and return a list the names of all pages that
contain the word. When STRING2 is passed to SCAN-HELP-PAGES,
it is interpreted as a string of options. The following
options will be evaluated:

        a  Search for substrings instead of full words.
           This options typically yields more results.
        c  Find missing pages, i.e. pages that are linked
           in the help index but not present in the file
           system. Ignore STRING1.
        l  Return not only the page names but also the
           context (up to three lines) in which the match
           was found: (page-name (line1 line2 line3)).
        p  Print the results instead of returning them.
           In this case, the result of FIND-HELP is
           unspecific.

Unknown option characters will be ingored.
