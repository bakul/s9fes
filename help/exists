S9 LIB  (exists procedure list ...)  ==>  boolean

Test whether a given property exists in a sequence of N lists.
The property is expressed using the N-ary predicate P, which
is given in the procedure argument. P is first applied to a
list consisting of the first member of each given list. If P
returns truth, EXISTS returns #T immediately. Otherwise it is
applied to a list consisting of the second members of the given
lists, etc. If P returns falsity for all sets of members, EXISTS
returns #F.
