R4RS 6.10.4  (load string)  ==>  unspecific

STRING should be a file name naming an existing file containing
Scheme source code. The LOAD procedure reads expressions and
definitions from the file and evaluates them sequentially. It is
unspecified whether the results of the expressions are printed.
The LOAD procedure does not affect the values returned by
CURRENT-INPUT-PORT and CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT. LOAD returns an
unspecified value.

Rationale: For portability, LOAD must operate on source files. Its
operation on other kinds of files necessarily varies among
implementations.
