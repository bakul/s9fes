R4RS 6.10  (with-input-from-file string procedure^0)  ==>  object
           (with-output-to-file string procedure^0)   ==>  object

PROCEDURE^0 must be a procedure of no arguments, and STRING must
be a string naming a file. For WITH-INPUT-FROM-FILE, the file must
already exist; for WITH-OUTPUT-TO-FILE, the effect is unspecified
if the file already exists. The file is opened for input or output,
an input or output port connected to it is made the default value
returned by CURRENT-INPUT-PORT or CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT, and the thunk
is called with no arguments.  When the thunk returns, the port is
closed and the previous default is restored. WITH-INPUT-FROM-FILE
and WITH-OUTPUT-TO-FILE return the value yielded by PROCEDURE^0.

S9fES silently overwrites the existing file when the file specified
with WITH-OUTPUT-TO-FILE already exists.
