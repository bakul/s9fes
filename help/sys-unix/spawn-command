S9 LIB  (spawn-command string list)     ==>  list
        (spawn-command/fd string list)  ==>  list

        (load-from-library "spawn-command.scm")

Spawn a child process running the command STRING with the arguments
listed in LIST. Return a list of two I/O-ports and the PID of the
child process:

        (input-port output-port integer)

Note that the full path of the command must be spcified and no
shell operators like <, >, &, etc may be used. When PATH search
or shell operators are needed, use SPAWN-SHELL-COMMAND instead.

The input-port can be used to read the output of the command and
the output-port to send input to the command. Error output of the
child will be redirected to its standard output.

SPAWN-COMMAND/FD is like SPAWN-COMMAND, but delivers raw Unix file
descriptors instead of input/output ports.

(spawn-command "/bin/ls" '(" -l" "/bin"))
  ==>  (#<input-port> #<output-port> 707)
