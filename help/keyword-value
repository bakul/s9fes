S9 LIB  (accept-keywords string list1 list2)  ==>  #t | undefined
        (keyword-value list symbol)           ==>  object | undefined
        (keyword-value list symbol object)    ==>  object

KEYWORD-VALUE finds the value associated with a keyword in a property
list (keywords in odd positions, values in even positions). When the
keyword is not found in the plist and a default OBJECT is specified,
that object is returned. When the keyword is not found and no default
is given, an error is signalled.

ACCEPT-KEYWORDS checks each keyword in LIST1 against symbols listed
in LIST2. When LIST1 contains a keyword not contained in LIST2, it
signals an error. It also signals an error when LIST1 contains a
trailing keyword (without an associated value).
When reporting an error ACCEPT-KEYWORD will insert the given STRING
as the source of the error.

(keyword-value '(foo 1 bar 2) 'bar)  ==>  2
(keyword-value '(foo 1) 'bar 0)      ==>  0

(accept-keywords "test" '(foo 1 bar 2) '(foo bar))  ==>  #t
