Display the synopsis of the given procedure or keyword. When
SYMBOL is described in R4RS, produce its R4RS entry, otherwise
display a S9FES-specific summary. When no argument is passed
to HELP, it explains itself.

APROPOS returns a list of all procedure names for which help
pages exist. When an argument is passed to APROPOS, its output
is limited to topics whose name contains the argument.

The *LINES-PER-PAGE* variable controls the number of lines
to be printed by HELP before prompting. Set to #F for continuous
printing.
