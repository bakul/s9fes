S9 LIB  (scm2html <option> ...)  ==>  string | unspecific

Render Scheme code in HTML with syntax highlighting and optional
CSS-based paren-matching. Input is read from (current-input-stream)
and output is written to (current-output-stream) unless the
'INPUT-STRING: option is specified (see below).

The rendition of the Scheme code will be placed in a PRE container
of the class "scheme" (<PRE class=scheme>). When paren-matching is
enabled, the class will change to "scheme-hl".

The following container classes are used to specify the colors
and other styles of the individual elements:

      o  comment
      p  parenthesis
      s  symbol
      c  constant
      r  R4RS procedure
      y  R4RS syntax
      x  S9fES procedure
      z  S9fES syntax
      m  normal form
      n  nested expression (for paren matching)

See the "scheme.css" style sheet for examples.

The following <option>s exist;

'FULL-HTML: boolean
      When set to #T, SCM2HTML will output a full HTML document
      and not just a PRE container. Will not work in string mode.

'LOUT-MODE: boolean
      Generate Lout output rather than HTML output.

'TROFF-MODE: boolean
      Generate TROFF output rather than HTML output.

'INPUT-STRING: string
      Input is read from a string and output is written to a string.
      In string mode, the 'FULL-HTML: option does not work. When this
      option is set, the result of the procedure will be of the form:

              (attributes string)

      where STRING is the output of the rendering process. See the
      description of 'INITIAL-STYLE: for more information on the
      ATTRIBUTES part. The output string of SCM2HTML is always
      lacking a trailing </SPAN> element.

'INITIAL-STYLE: list
      Initialize the color class and boldface flag with the values taken
      from LIST. LIST should be the car part of an object returned by
      SCM2HTML previously. It allows to render multiple lines that are
      logically connected by preserving the style across line boundaries.

'MARK-S9-PROCS: boolean
      When set to #T, S9fES procedures will be highlighted with an
      extra color. Otherwise, they will be rendered in the same color
      as user-defined symbols.

'MARK-S9-EXTNS: boolean
      When set to #T, S9fES syntax extensions will be highlighted with
      an extra color. Otherwise, they will be rendered in the same color
      as user-defined symbols.

'SHOW-MATCHES: boolean
      When set to #T, SCM2HTML will insert CSS code that allow to match
      parentheses interactively in the resulting code by moving the
      cursor over expressions. Does not work in string mode.

'TILDE-QUOTES: boolean
      When set to #T, #\~ characters in programs will serve is
      invisible quotation. Used to facilitate the rendering of
      evaluation sequences.

'TERMINATE: list
      Return termination tags for the color and boldface settings
      specified in LIST (see INPUT-STRING:).

(scm2html 'input-string: "'()")
   ==> (("c" #f quote 0 ())
        "<SPAN class=y><B>'</B></SPAN><SPAN class=c>()")
