S9 LIB  (name->file-name string)  ==>  string

        (load-from-library "name-to-file-name.scm")

Map the given symbol name to a name that is a valid file name
on most computer file systems. In particular, the procedure
replaces the following characters:

        character(s)  becomes
           @          at
           +          plus
           *          star
           /          slash
           ?          p (predicate)
           !          b (bang)
           =          eq
           ->         -to-
           <          lt
           <=         le
           >          gt
           >=         ge

In addition a name that consists of a minus sign exclusively
("-") is replaced with "minus". All other special characters
are replaced with an underscore. Non-special characters include
the letters a-z, the digits 0-9, the minus sign, and the dot.

 (name->file-name "sys:stat-pipe?")   ==>  "sys_stat-pipep"
 (name->file-name "a->b")             ==>  "a-to-b"
 (name->file-name "*foo*")            ==>  "starfoostar"
