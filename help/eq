These procedures return #T if their arguments are (respectively):
equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, monotonically
nondecreasing, or monotonically non-increasing.

These predicates are required to be transitive.

Note: The traditional implementations of these predicates in Lisp-like
languages are not transitive. 

Note: While it is not an error to compare inexact numbers using
these predicates, the results may be unreliable because a small
inaccuracy may affect the result; this is especially true of = and
ZERO?. When in doubt, consult a numerical analyst.
