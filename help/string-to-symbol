R4RS 6.4  (string->symbol string)  ==>  symbol

Returns the symbol whose name is STRING. This procedure can create
symbols with names containing special characters or letters in the
non-standard case, but it is usually a bad idea to create such
symbols because in some implementations of Scheme they cannot be
read as themselves. See SYMBOL->STRING.

The following examples assume that the implementation's standard
case is lower case:

(eq? 'mISSISSIppi 'mississippi)                    ==>  #t
(string->symbol "mISSISSIppi")                     ==>  the symbol with
                                                        name "mISSISSIppi"
(eq? 'bitBlt (string->symbol "bitBlt"))            ==>  #f
(eq? 'JollyWog
     (string->symbol (symbol->string 'JollyWog)))  ==>  #t

(string=? (symbol->string (string->symbol "K. Harper, M.D."))
          "K. Harper, M.D."                        ==>  #t
