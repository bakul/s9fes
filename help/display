R4RS 6.10.3  (display object)              ==>  unspecific
             (display object output-port)  ==>  unspecific

Writes a representation of OBJECT to the given OUTPUT-PORT. Strings
that appear in the written representation are not enclosed in
double quotes, and no characters are escaped within those strings.
Character objects appear in the representation as if written by
write-char instead of by write. DISPLAY returns an unspecified
value. The OUTPUT-PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it
defaults to the value returned by CURRENT-OUTPUT-PORT.

Rationale: WRITE is intended for producing machine-readable output
and DISPLAY is for producing human-readable output. Implementations
that allow "slashification" within symbols will probably want WRITE
but not DISPLAY to slashify funny characters in symbols.
