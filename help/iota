S9 LIB  (iota integer)             ==>  list

        (iota* integer1 integer2)  ==>  list

        (load-from-library "iota.scm")

IOTA creates a sequence of integers starting at 1 and ending
at INTEGER (including both). When a second argument is passed
to IOTA, the sequence returned by it will start at INTEGER1
and ; end at INTEGER2 (again, including both).

IOTA* differs from IOTA in two ways: it always takes two
arguments and excludes INTEGER2 from the generated sequence.

(iota 7)       ==>  (1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
(iota 17 21)   ==>  (17 18 19 20 21)
(iota* 17 21)  ==>  (17 18 19 20)
(iota* 1 1)    ==>  ()
