R4RS 6.5.6  (number->string number)          ==>  string
            (number->string number integer)  ==>  string

INTEGER must be a radix of either 2, 8, 10, or 16. If omitted, it
defaults to 10. The procedure NUMBER->STRING takes a number and a
radix and returns as a string an external representation of the
given number in the given radix such that

(let ((number number)
      (radix radix))
  (eqv? number
        (string->number (number->string number radix)
                        radix)))

is true. It is an error if no possible result makes this expression
true.

If NUMBER is inexact, the radix is 10, and the above expression can
be satisfied by a result that contains a decimal point, then the
result contains a decimal point and is expressed using the minimum
number of digits (exclusive of exponent and trailing zeros) needed
to make the above expression true; otherwise the format of the result
is unspecified.

The result returned by NUMBER->STRING never contains an explicit
radix prefix.
