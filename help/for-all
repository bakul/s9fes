S9 LIB  (for-all procedure list ...)  ==>  object

Test whether all members of a sequence of N lists have a given
property. The property is expressed using an N-ary predicate P,
which is given in the procedure argument. P is applied to a list
consisting of the first member of each given list. If P returns
truth, it is applied to a list consisting of the second member of
each given list, etc. If P returns falsity for any set of members,
FOR-ALL returns #F. If only one set of members is left to check,
FOR-ALL returns the value of P applied to this final set.
When the LISTs are empty, FOR-ALL returns #T.

(for-all < '(1 7) '(2 8) '(3 9))  ==>  #t
; because (< 1 2 3) and (< 7 8 9)
