S9 LIB  (listq object ...)  ==>  list

LISTQ is like LIST, but quotes each OBJECT passed to it.
Rationale: (list a b c)    evaluates a, b, and c
           '(a b c)        makes the list immutable
           `(a b c)        may be inefficient
           (list 'a 'b 'c) is awkward

(listq a (b c) d)  ==>  (a (b c) d)
