Find the first occurrence of a small string STRING1 in a large
string STRING2. Return the position of the first occurrence of
STRING1 in STRING2 (positions start at 0). When STRING2 does not
contain STRING1, return #F. STRING-CI-POSITION performs the same
function, but ignores case.

STRING-WORD-POSITION (STRING-CI-WORD-POSITION) differs from
STRING-POSITION (STRING-CI-POSITION) in that is matches only full
words, where a full word is a subsequence of characters that is
delimited on both sides by one of the following:

        - the beginning of the string;
        - the end of the string;
        - a non-alphabetic character.

(string-position "ein" "gemeinsam")     ==>  3
(string-position "people" "democracy")  ==>  #f
(string-word-position "me" "test me")   ==>  5
(string-word-position "me" "testme")    ==>  #f
