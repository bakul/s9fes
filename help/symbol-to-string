R4RS 6.4  (symbol->string symbol)  ==>  string

Returns the name of SYMBOL as a string. If the symbol was part of
an object returned as the value of a literal expression (section
see section 4.1.2 Literal expressions) or by a call to the READ
procedure, and its name contains alphabetic characters, then the
string returned will contain characters in the implementation's
preferred standard case--some implementations will prefer upper
case, others lower case. If the symbol was returned by STRING->SYMBOL,
the case of characters in the string returned will be the same as
the case in the string that was passed to STRING->SYMBOL. It is an
error to apply mutation procedures like STRING-SET! to strings
returned by this procedure.

The following examples assume that the implementation's standard
case is lower case:

(symbol->string 'flying-fish)                ==>  "flying-fish"
(symbol->string 'Martin)                     ==>  "martin"
(symbol->string (string->symbol "Malvina"))  ==>  "Malvina"
