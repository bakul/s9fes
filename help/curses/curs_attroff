Curses routines for changing screen attributes. This is only a rough
summary. See the curses(3) manual page or a curses tutorial of your
choice for further information.

CURS:ATTROFF removes the specified attribute (INTEGER) from the
set of attributes currently in effect.

CURS:ATTRON adds the specified attribute (INTEGER) to the set of
attributes currently in effect.

CURS:ATTRSET replaces the current attribute set by the one specified
in its argument. The following attributes may be combined with a
BITWISE-OR (q.v.) operation or by calling CURS:ATTRON multiple times:

        CURS:ATTR-NORMAL
        CURS:ATTR-STANDOUT
        CURS:ATTR-UNDERLINE
        CURS:ATTR-BOLD

CURS:STANDOUT is shorthand for (curs:attrset curs:attr-standout).
CURS:STANDEND is shorthand for (curs:attrset curs:attr-normal).

The attribute operation affect all subsequent screen output operations.

Not all (hardware) terminals support combinations of attributes.
Most emulators do.
