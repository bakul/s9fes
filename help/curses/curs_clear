Curses routines for clearing the screen. This is only a rough
summary. See the curses(3) manual page or a curses tutorial of
your choice for further information.

These routines do not cause any effect before CURS:REFRESH (q.v.)
is called.

CURS:CLEAR clears the entire virtual screen.

CURS:CLRTOBOT clears the current line from the current column
of the virtual cursor to the end of the line as well as all
lines below the virtual cursor.

CURS:CLRTOEOL clears the current line from the current column
of the virtual cursor to the end of the line.
