Curses routines for inserting and deleting lines and characters on
the screen. This is only a rough summary. See the curses(3) manual
page or a curses tutorial of your choice for further information.

All of these operations will not take effect before CURS:REFRESH
is called.

CURS:DELCH deletes the character on the current virtual cursor
position from the virtual screen. Characters to the right of
the current position will move to the left to fill the resulting
gap.

CURS:DELETELN deletes all characters in the current line of the
virtual cursor. All lines below that line will move up to fill
the resulting gap.

CURS:INSCH inserts a blank character at the current virtual cursor
position into the virtual screen. All characters to the right of
the current position will move to the right to make space for the
new character.

CURS:INSERTLN inserts a blank line at the current virtual cursor
position. All lines below that line will move down make space for
the new line.

CURS:MVDELCH deletes a character from a specific position.

CURS:MVINSCH inserts a blank character at a specific position.
