Curses routines for writing to the screen. This is only a rough
summary. See the curses(3) manual page or a curses tutorial of
your choice for further information.

CURS:ADDCH writes CHAR to the current virtual cursor position.

CURS:ADDSTR writes STRING to the current virtual cursor position.

CURS:BEEP rings the audible terminal bell immediately.

CURS:FLASH flashes the terminal screen immediately.

CURS:MOVE moves the virtual cursor to row INTEGER_Y and column
INTEGER_X. This means that coordinates are specified as Y,X!

CURS:MVADDCH and CURS:MVADDSTR first move the cursor to Y=INTEGER_Y
and X=INTEGER_X and then perform a ADDCH or ADDSTR operation
respectively.

CURS:SCROLL scrolls the screen by the given number of rows. When
INTEGER is negative, it scrolls up.

CURS:REFRESH commits all pending output operations. No writes
to the physical screen will be performed until CURS:REFRESH (or
CURS:GETCH; q.v.) is called.
