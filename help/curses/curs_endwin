Routines for initializing and shutting down curses. This is only
a rough summary. See the curses(3) manual page or a curses tutorial
of your choice for further information.

CURS:ENDWIN restores the terminal state that was in effect before
initializing curses. No curses routines may be called after running
CURS:ENDWIN. (Exception: CURS:GET-MAGI-VALUE.)

CURS:INITSCR initializes the curses interface. No curses routines may
be called prior to running CURS:INITSCR.
(Exception: CURS:GET-MAGI-VALUE.)

Typical curses-based programs will use the following setup:

        (curs:initscr)
        (curs:cbreak)   ; or (curs:raw)
        (curs:noecho)
        (curs:nonl)
        (curs:keypad #t)
