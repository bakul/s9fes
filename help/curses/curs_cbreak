Curses routines for configuring the terminal. This is only a rough
summary. See the curses(3) manual page or a curses tutorial of your
choice for further information.

CURS:CBREAK switches the terminal to "cbreak" mode. In cbreak mode
characters are delivered to the calling program as soon as they are
typed. Cbreak and raw mode exclude each other.

CURS:NOCBREAK switches the terminal to "cooked" mode. In cooked
mode, input will only be delivered to the calling program when the
RETURN key is pressed on the terminal. Input buffering and basic
editing (erasing characters) will be handled by the TTY driver.

CURS:ECHO enables "echo" mode. In echo mode, all input will be
echoed to the virtual screen.

CURS:NOECHO disables echo mode.

CURS:GET-MAGIC-VALUE retrieves a magic constant from the curses
library (e.g.: key codes or screen attributes). When the requested
constant could not be delivered, an error is signalled the calling
program is terminated.

CURS:IDLOK enables or disables the hardware insert line/delete line
commands, if supported by the terminal. When these commands are
disabled lines are inserted and deleted by rewriting the bottom
of the screen completely.

CURS:KEYPAD enables or disables "keypad" mode. In keypad mode,
Curses will interpret escape sequences sent by "special" keys and
translate them to key codes. See CURS:GETCH for details. When
keypad mode is disabled, CURS:GETCH will deliver the individual
parts of the sequence instead, leaving interpretation to the
calling program.

CURS:NL enables "newline" mode. In newline mode, RETURN will be
translated to newline on input and newline to carriage return
plus line-feed on output.

CURS:NONL disables newline mode. Characters will not be translated
on input or output.

CURS:NODELAY enables or disables "nodelay" mode. In nodelay
mode CURS:GETCH does not block and delivers #F when there are
no characters in the keyboard queue.

CURS:RAW switches the terminal to "raw" mode. Raw mode is like
cbreak mode, but in addition passes trough the interrupt, quit,
suspend, XON, and XOFF characters without interpreting them.
Cbreak and raw mode exclude each other.

CURS:NORAW ends raw mode.

CURS:SAVETTY saves the current terminal state in an internal
buffer. CURS:RESETTY restores the state from that buffer.

CURS:SCROLLOK enables and disables scroll mode. In scroll mode,
emitting a newline character in the bollom line of the screen
or writing past the last column of the last row of the screen
will cause the screen to scroll up automatically. When scroll
mode is disabled, no auto-scrolling will be initiated.

Hardware line insert/delete has to be activated in addition
to enable hardware scrolling. (See CURS:IDLOK.)
