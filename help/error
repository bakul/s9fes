S9fES  (error string)         ==>  undefined
       (error string object)  ==>  undefined

Display the message in STRING. If OBJECT is given, display a colon,
a space character, and the external representation of OBJECT after
the message. After printing the message, abort evaluation. No result
is returned.

Rationale: ERROR is used by S9fES programs to signal errors.
