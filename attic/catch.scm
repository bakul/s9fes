;
; Implement Common LISP-style CATCH and THROW. <Tag> must evaluate to
; an object that can be checked for identity using EQ? (typically a
; symbol). CATCH establishes a catch named <tag> and then evaluates
; the given <statement>s in an implicit BEGIN. Unless one of the
; statements executes THROW, the value of the last <statement> will
; be returned. When a <statement> executes THROW, control will be
; passed to the innermost catch with the same <tag> as the throw.
; In this case the catch will exit immediately, returning the value
; of <expression> as its result.
;
; CATCH/THROW is built into Scheme 9 Reimagined and this implementation
; clashes with it, because S9 now inlines CATCH and THROW.

; DON'T USE THIS!

; (Example:) (let ((v #f))
;              (let ((r (catch 'foo
;                         (set! v 0)
;                         (throw 'foo 1)
;                         (set! v 2)
;                         3)))
;                (list v r)))             ==>  (0 1)
