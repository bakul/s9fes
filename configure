To compile a full S9fES system with all extensions, try "make all".
This should work fine on *BSD and Linux. Refer to the README and
Makefile for further instructions.

To compile a bare-bones S9fES system in a Unix user land, run:

	cc -o s9 s9.c s9core.c
	./s9 -i - -d s9.image

To compile the S9fES system on a native (386-based) Plan 9 system:

	8c -Dplan9 -o s9 s9.c s9core.c
	./s9 -i - -d s9.image

Good Luck!  I hope you'll enjoy using Scheme 9 from Empty Space!
